# Exploring Implicit Bias: Slovenian vs. Non-Slovenian IAT Study

## Overview

This project is a MinnoJS-based online study designed to explore implicit biases, with a focus on perceptions of Slovenian and non-Slovenian individuals. It was developed as part of the “Localization and Translation Projects” course at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Arts. The study utilizes OSF (Open Science Framework) and DataPipe for secure data storage and management, ensuring reliable handling of participant information. The study is hosted and deployed via GitHub Pages, providing broad accessibility and scalability.

## Description

Participants engage in an Implicit Association Test (IAT) where they are asked to quickly sort names into groups, measuring underlying mental associations. In addition to the IAT, participants answer basic demographic questions and provide responses to explicit attitude statements. The entire study takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.

The platform was developed using MinnoJS to ensure an interactive and user-friendly experience, facilitating seamless data collection on both implicit and explicit biases. 

## Data

Collected data is securely stored and managed through integration with OSF and DataPipe, promoting transparency, accountability, and adherence to data privacy standards. The online setup via GitHub Pages allows participation from a broad audience, enriching the depth and diversity of the study’s dataset.
