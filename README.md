# Slovenian and Nonslovenian IAT Study

## Overview  
This project is a MinnoJS-based online study that examines gender and race bias, developed as part of the “Localization and Translation Projects” course at the University of Ljubljana. The study integrates data storage and management tools, specifically OSF (Open Science Framework) and DataPipe, to ensure secure and efficient handling of participant data. The study is hosted and deployed via GitHub Pages for easy access and scalability.

## Description  
The online study aims to gather insights on how implicit biases related to gender and race influence participants’ reactions and choices. The study is divided into multiple parts: introductory content, an implicit association test (IAT), demographic questions, and explicit bias statements. The platform was built using MinnoJS, a powerful framework for creating interactive surveys and experiments. The data from the participants is securely stored and analyzed through the integration with OSF and DataPipe. This ensures both transparency and compliance with data privacy standards. The study is accessible online via GitHub Pages, allowing for easy participation and data collection from a wide pool of participants.
