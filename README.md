# Exploring Implicit Bias: Slovenian vs Nonslovenian IAT Study

## Overview  
This project is a MinnoJS-based online study that explores gender and race biases, focusing on Slovenian and nonslovenian participants. It was developed as part of the “Localization and Translation Projects” course at the University of Ljubljana. The study utilizes OSF (Open Science Framework) and DataPipe for secure data storage and management, ensuring efficient handling of participant information. The study is hosted and deployed via GitHub Pages for easy access and scalability.

## Description  
The online study aims to investigate implicit biases regarding gender and race, specifically in relation to Slovenian and nonslovenian individuals. The study consists of several key sections: introductory content, an Implicit Association Test (IAT), demographic questions, and explicit bias statements. Using MinnoJS, the platform was designed to facilitate seamless interaction with participants, allowing for the collection of implicit and explicit bias data.

## Data
The data collected from participants is securely stored and analyzed through OSF and DataPipe integration, promoting transparency, accountability, and adherence to data privacy standards. The study is available online via GitHub Pages, enabling easy participation from a broad pool of participants, contributing to the richness of the study’s findings.
